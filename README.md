# Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

This is a little `About Me` app I've created but still is a WIP. I'ved used Typescript, React and CSS. Check it out here https://orlanugent.netlify.app/ âœ¨

# TODOs

- A project section to display the current projects I'm working on
- Create `Carousel` componenent. I've made a start on this but not ready yet so used static cards for now
